# Lab 06 Notes:

# Terminology

- Authentication
  - Making sure you are who you say you are

- Authorization
  - Making sure that the user is allowed to be where they are trying to be / what you can do based on who you are

- cryptographic hash
  - a way to represent some text (enciphered) so it can stored securely... this can be stored in place of a password to verify user
  - not secure/ hack into information

- encoding
  - can be decoded
  - mutated data using a specific sequence to modify it
  - base-64 encode things for basic auth

- encryption
  - can't be decoded
  - bcrypt is the library we are using
  - some additional data is sprinkled/added in (salt)
